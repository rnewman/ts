This package is a starting point for developing modern TypeScript (4.4 at the
time of writing) with modern Node (16), including tests and linting, because
everywhere you look are outdated blog posts and examples. (Yes, this will end
up as one!)

It includes a working `tsconfig.json`, Jest tests and an eslint configuration
that work in Visual Studio Code, and a simple `main.ts` file that is bundled by
`esbuild`.

Simply copy the contents of this repo and run `npm install`.

See the `scripts` section of `package.json` to see what else you can do.

I'm making this available under the MIT-0 license so you can get started
without worries.
